//Bottom-up DP / Two pointers


Intuitively, we list all the substrings, pick those palindromic, and get the longest one. This approach takes O(n^3) time complexity, where n is the length of s.

Dynamic Programming
The problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times. Overlapping subproblems lead us to Dynamic Programming.

We decompose the problem as follows:

State variable
The start index and end index of a substring can identify a state, which influences our decision.
So the state variable is state(start, end) indicates whether s[start, end] inclusive is palindromic

Goal state
max(end - start + 1) for all state(start, end) = true

State transition

for start = end (e.g. 'a'), state(start, end) is True
for start + 1 = end (e.g. 'aa'), state(start, end) is True if s[start] = s[end]
for start + 2 = end (e.g. 'aba'),  state(start, end) is True if s[start] = s[end] and state(start + 1, end - 1)
for start + 3 = end (e.g. 'abba'),  state(start, end) is True if s[start] = s[end] and state(start + 1, end - 1)
...
This approach takes O(n^2) time complexity, O(n^2) space complexity, where n is the length of s.

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = True
        longest_palindrome_start, longest_palindrome_len = 0, 1

        for end in range(0, n):
            for start in range(end - 1, -1, -1):
                # print('start: %s, end: %s' % (start, end))
                if s[start] == s[end]:
                    if end - start == 1 or dp[start + 1][end - 1]:
                        dp[start][end] = True
                        palindrome_len = end - start + 1
                        if longest_palindrome_len < palindrome_len:
                            longest_palindrome_start = start
                            longest_palindrome_len = palindrome_len
        return s[longest_palindrome_start: longest_palindrome_start + longest_palindrome_len]
Two pointers
This approach takes O(n^2) time complexity, O(1) space complexity, where n is the length of s.

For each character s[i], we get the first character to its right which isn't equal to s[i].
Then s[i, right - 1] inclusive are equal characters e.g. "aaa".
Then we make left = i - 1, while s[left] == s[right], s[left, right] inclusive is palindrome, and we keep extending both ends by left -= 1, right += 1.
Finally we update the tracked longest palindrome if needed.

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        longest_palindrome_start, longest_palindrome_len = 0, 1

        for i in range(0, n):
            right = i
            while right < n and s[i] == s[right]:
                right += 1
            # s[i, right - 1] inclusive are equal characters e.g. "aaa"
            
            # while s[left] == s[right], s[left, right] inclusive is palindrome e.g. "baaab"
            left = i - 1
            while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:
                left -= 1
                right += 1
            
            # s[left + 1, right - 1] inclusive is palindromic
            palindrome_len = right - left - 1
            if palindrome_len > longest_palindrome_len:
                longest_palindrome_len = palindrome_len
                longest_palindrome_start = left + 1
            
        return s[longest_palindrome_start: longest_palindrome_start + longest_palindrome_len]
